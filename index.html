            Who will win the 2024 Election? Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? The race is a dead heat
            in many key swing states. Many analysts predict the election will come down to about
            60,000 voters in seven key swing states, but three in particular. This conference will explore
            the critical roles that religion, race, and gender will play in shaping the final outcome across
            the nation and in key swing states. Some of the leading scholars from across the nation will
            analyze how key segments of the American electorate are leaning in their vote: Catholics,
            Protestants, Evangelicals, Muslims, Women, Asians, Blacks, and Latinos. After briefly
            tracing how they have voted from 2000-2020, the speakers will then draw on the latest
            national survey data and polls to discuss how they are currently leaning going into Election
            Day, in some cases breaking down their analyses by gender, race, generation, religious
            tradition, and/or other key variables. They will then reflect on what domestic and foreign
            policies, social issues, and personal qualities, assets, and liabilities may attract (or repel)
            voters to Harris or Trump and then answer questions from the audience.
